I just set up this site and blog. The whole process took me around five hours, and it was made trivially easy thanks to Github Pages, Jekyll and Jekyll Bootstrap. I don't pay for hosting, the site is on one of the most reliable hosts there is, and I get to write content in Markdown directly in my favourite text editor. Compare to five years ago, when your choices for a site like this were: 

a. hand code it
b. Wordpress
c. Drupal/Joomla/etc. 

Those were all overkill for what I wanted: just a simple site where I can share my thoughts and keep a basic profile.

This time, it was too easy. In case you want to do something similar, here's a quick rundown of how to do it.

### Github Pages

Github, for those who have been living under a rock, is a site that blends source code version contol with social networking. It's *the* place to host your open source code. Github Pages is an awesome service from Github which allows you to host a static site free from a Github repository. You can make simple pages for programming projects using the built-in templates, as I have for [chain](chain) and [biopsy](biopsy), or you can make a page for yourself or your organisation.
