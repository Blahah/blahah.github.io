### Outline:

- Traditional print publishers used to require copyright assignment from journal article authors
- They mostly still do

    - http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/faqs_copyright.asp#1.1
    - http://journalauthors.tandf.co.uk/copyright/assignmentAndYourRights.asp
- Totally bogus in the context of modern publishing
- Dissect the justification given and the extent of the problem

- The US Copyright Act 1976 [allows for the revocation of Copyright Transfer Agreements between 35 and 40 years after original assignment or publication](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/203)
- Suggest organisation of Academics with eligible articles, with a template service to help them reclaim copyright and make open release of their work.
