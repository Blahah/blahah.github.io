Key challenges:

1. Current science career incentives don't promote openness or reproducibility. We need to think about incentives for following best practise. Without that, most scientists simply won't care about these things.

2. Training is poor, mainly because most trainers don't stay current and follow best practise themselves.

3. Glamour publishing and the major for-profit publishers are diametrically opposed to the goals of open science. That entire infrastructure needs to be systematically dismantled.

Who am I:

I am a PhD student in Plant Sciences at Cambridge. I try to set an example in both openness and reproducibility in my daily work. This includes:
- making all code and formal writing online and open before publication the same day I write it (https://github.com/Blahah/)
- all analyses and pipelines for papers are open source and reproducible with a single command (e.g. https://github.com/HibberdLab/flaveria_pipeline)
- the interim reports I produce for collaborators are online: http://rpubs.com/blahah
- as the first computational student in my lab I've been setting up best-practice workflows for the entire lab, with everything being open, documented and reproducible (some examples at https://github.com/HibberdLab)
- I raise awareness of these issues with my colleagues, including trying to convince my collaborators and supervisor that it's important (sometimes to their obvious irritation).

Outside my PhD I'm involved in various organisations and projects that are related to openness. I founded http://solvers.io to help scientists collaborate with the public. I'm also the technical lead on scraping and crawling for the ContentMine project (http://contentmine.org) that is mining the entire scientific literature and releasing annotated, uncopyrightable facts.

I'd like to see:

- productive conversations with interested people
- us setting an example by opening up our discussions to the wider world (e.g. putting results online, having collaborative discussions online or inviting comment from non-attendees during the meeting)

Biography:

I'm a PhD student in Plant Sciences at Cambridge where I work on understanding the genetic regulation of photosynthesis so we can make it more efficient. I'm also a hacker, an openness activist, and I have too many cats.
