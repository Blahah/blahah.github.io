Last year there was a paper published that looked *very* exciting: RNAseq quantification without aligning the reads. The potential speed increase looked so dramatic that I gave it a try immediately. We did some quick runs of sailfish and compared it to what we were previously using, eXpress. Excitement turned to dissappointment as we saw that the expression distribution across all transcripts in our test set was skewed in strange ways in the sailfish results.

We didn't give it much more thought - just chalked it up to the fundamental limitations of a kmer-based quantification tool.

Then a few weeks later, twitter informed me that it was, ridiculously, fish facts day. Seeing an opportunity for a throwaway snide remark, I compose a tweet:


I'm funny right? Right?
