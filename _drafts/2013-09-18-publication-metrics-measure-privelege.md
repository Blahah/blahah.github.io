Recent AltMetrics blog post about gaming AltMetrics http://www.altmetric.com/blog/gaming-altmetrics/

Points out that they consider it gaming when researchers pay for social media attention to their work.

Why should financial privelege be treated dfferently from the social privelege of a researcher who asks a colleage to review for F1000? Privelege in general is the problem, and publication metrics, including AltMetrics, are making it worse.

Quality of the science unrelated to perceived impact.
