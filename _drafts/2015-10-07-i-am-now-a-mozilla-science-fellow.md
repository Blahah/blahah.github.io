With great delight, I can announce that for the next 10 months I will be a Mozilla Fellow for Science. This is extremely exciting, not just because I get to focus my energy on open science, but because I will be working with and learning from some seriously impressive people: the [three other fellows](https://www.mozillascience.org/announcing-our-2015-mozilla-fellows-for-science) and the [Mozilla Science Lab team](). 

For me this opportunity is a validation that the things I care about are important to others too, and that the strategy I've been using to encourage change is working. So, what do I plan to do with my 10 months?

### The application process

The fellowship application call went out in [TODO: when?], with a deadline of August 14th. That wasn't a long time to prepare, and it couldn't have been worse timing for me as our son Max was born a month before the deadline.
