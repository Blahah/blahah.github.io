I'm Richard Smith - a biologist, hacker, and PhD student in Plant Sciences in [the Hibberd Lab](http://hibberdlab.com) at the University of Cambridge.

My name is so common as to be effectively anonymous, so online I go by *blahah* or *blahah404* depending on availability. Yeah, that's an HTTP status code reference.

My PHD is about deciphering the genetic basis of a [particularly efficient kind of photosynthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation), so we can work out how to [make crops more productive](http://c4rice.irri.org/) for the poorest people in the world.

Day to day, that means analysing next-generation sequencing data and [writing bioinformatics software](projects.html) to make those analyses more effective.

In the rare moments when I'm not at a computer screen or lab bench, I hang out with my [awesome girlfriend](https://plus.google.com/106549473620813273259/) and our growing collection of kittens.

Find me on [Github](https://github.com/Blahah), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Smith13/), [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/users/443912/richard-smith), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blahah404) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/108642235198565174600).
