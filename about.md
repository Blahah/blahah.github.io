I'm Richard Smith - a biologist, hacker, and PhD student in Plant Sciences in [the Hibberd Lab](http://hibberdlab.net) at the University of Cambridge.

By day, I try to make photosynthesis more efficient. By night, I make software that makes computational biology easier and better. Sometimes I [write about plant science](http://phyta.org), because public understanding of it is polluted beyond belief.

In the rare moments when I'm not at a computer screen or lab bench, I hang out with my [awesome girlfriend](https://plus.google.com/106549473620813273259/) and our growing collection of kittens.

Find me on [Github](https://github.com/Blahah), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Smith13/), [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/users/443912/richard-smith) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/108642235198565174600).
