I'm Richard Smith - a biologist, hacker, and PhD student in Plant Sciences in [the Hibberd Lab](http://hibberdlab.com) at the University of Cambridge.

My handle is *blahah* or *blahah404* (depending on availability - yes that's an [HTTP status code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) reference).

I work on deciphering the genetic basis of a particularly efficient kind of photosynthesis, so we can work out how to make crops more productive. To make that possible, I [write bioinformatics software](projects.html). Sometimes I [write about plant science](http://phyta.org), because public understanding of it is polluted beyond belief.

In the rare moments when I'm not at a computer screen or lab bench, I hang out with my [awesome girlfriend](https://plus.google.com/106549473620813273259/) and our growing collection of kittens.

Find me on [Github](https://github.com/Blahah), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Smith13/), [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/users/443912/richard-smith) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/108642235198565174600).
