## Open science

- [Solvers.io](http://solvers.io), a place where programmers donate their skills meaningful science projects in need of help. Co-founder with [Dave Clayton](http://dave78.com/).

## Learning

- [AnkiMobile](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankisrs/id373493387?mt=8), the iOS version of the world's best flashcard app, [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/). This consumed me for most of 2012 (and funded my undergrad).

## Computational biology

These are all works in progress...

- [*transrate*](http://github.com/blahah/transrate), a command-line tool and Ruby library for quality analysis of de-novo transcriptome assemblies.
- [*chain*](http://github.com/blahah/chain), a tool for taming bioinformatic pipelines.
- [*biopsy*](http://github.com/blahah/biopsy), a framework for optimising any bioinformatic software.
- [*assemblotron*](http://github.com/blahah/assemblotron), fast, automated, optimal assembly of transcriptomes using *any* modern assembler.
- Tools for [RNAseq](https://github.com/HibberdLab/rnaseq_tools), [transcriptome assembly](https://github.com/HibberdLab/assemblytools), and [working with NGS data](https://github.com/HibberdLab/seqtools).

## General academia

- [hibberdlab.com](http://hibberdlab.com), the website for my lab.
