## Open science

- I am a [2015-2016 Mozilla Fellow for Science](http://blahah.net/2015/10/07/i-am-now-a-mozilla-science-fellow/)
- [Solvers.io](http://solvers.io), a place where programmers improve our world by donating their skills to meaningful science projects in need of help. Co-founder with [Dave Clayton](http://dave78.com/).
- [ContentMine](http://contentmine.org) ([also on Github](http://github.com/ContentMine)), a Shuttleworth Foundation funded project in which we are building the technology to mine the entire academic literature as it is published every day, and republish un-copyrightable facts to liberate knowledge for all.
- [*scraperJSON*](http://github.com/ContentMine/scraperJSON), a schema for defining reusable web scrapers as JSON objects.
- [*thresher*](http://github.com/ContentMine/thresher), a scraperJSON web scraping library for Node.js.
- [*quickscrape*](http://github.com/ContentMine/quickscrape), a command-line tool for scraperJSON web scraping that uses **thresher** as a backend.

## Learning

- [AnkiMobile](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankisrs/id373493387?mt=8), the iOS version of the world's best flashcard app, [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/). This consumed me for most of 2012 (and funded my undergrad).

## Computational biology

These are all works in progress...

- [*transrate*](http://hibberdlab.com/transrate) ([+ Github](http://github.com/blahah/transrate)), a command-line tool and Ruby library for quality analysis of de-novo transcriptome assemblies.
- [*chain*](http://github.com/blahah/chain), a tool for taming bioinformatic pipelines.
- [*biopsy*](http://github.com/blahah/biopsy), a framework for optimising any bioinformatic software.
- [*assemblotron*](http://github.com/blahah/assemblotron), fast, automated, optimal assembly of transcriptomes using *any* modern assembler.
- Tools for [RNAseq](https://github.com/HibberdLab/rnaseq_tools), [transcriptome assembly](https://github.com/HibberdLab/assemblytools), and [working with NGS data](https://github.com/HibberdLab/seqtools).

## General academia

- [hibberdlab.com](http://hibberdlab.com), the website for the lab I'm in.
